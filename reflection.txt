Reflection Report

Architecture and Workflow
The system is about Orchestrating agens with three unique agents: Inventory, Quote, and Sales. The orchestrator routes requests while each agent handles domain-specific tasks, like stock checks, quote generation, or transaction recording. The workflow diagram illustrates request routing and database interactions.

Implementation and Evaluation

Implemented in Python using SmolAgents, each agent tool is docstring-annotated for schema validation, and SQLite provides persistent storage. Evaluation from test_results.csv highlights:

-  Agents consistently return correct results.

- Database queries respond quickly.

- New tools or agents integrate with minimal changes.


Suggestions for Improvement

Took about 4 minutes to texecute everything, i would recommend better algorithims or better way to orchestrate the agents. 

Conclusion:
The system is a reliable multi-agent coordination with the basic uses of different agents and tools. Further enhancements could improve performance for larger deployments.
