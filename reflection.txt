Architecture and Workflow

The system is a multi-agent framework with three primary agents: Inventory, Quote, and Sales, coordinated by an orchestrator. Each agent handles a specific domain: Inventory checks stock, Quote generates pricing, and Sales records transactions.

The orchestrator routes requests to the correct agent, and results are stored in an SQLite database. This design emphasizes:

Modularity – Agents operate independently, making it easy to add new agents or tools.

Extensibility – Docstring-annotated tools enable automatic JSON schema validation.

Reliability – Persistent database storage maintains consistent state.


Implementation and Evaluation

Implemented in Python using SmolAgents, each agent uses schema-validated tools. Evaluation from test_results.csv shows:

Accuracy: Inventory queries returned correct results consistently.

Efficiency: Most database queries completed in under 0.5 seconds.

Modularity: Adding new agents or tools required minimal code changes.

Execution Time: Full test suite took ~4 minutes, highlighting opportunities for optimization.


Suggestions for Improvement

Optimize Orchestration: Introduce asynchronous or parallel processing to reduce execution time.

Enhance Scalability and Monitoring: Add performance metrics, error handling, and potentially new agents (e.g., for reporting or predictions).

Robust Input Validation: Improve agent-level validation to prevent failures from unexpected inputs.
